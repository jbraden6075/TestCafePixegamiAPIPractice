# Description

This repo is to practice API testing using TestCafe with Javascript. I will be using the todo.pixegami.io endpoint.

The documentation for the APIs can be found at todo.pixegami.io/docs where I will be creating positive tests
based on the SwaggerUI.

# TODO

Clean up the tests by creating helper methods to remove a lot of the duplicated code.
